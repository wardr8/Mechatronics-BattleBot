# Mechatronics-BattleBot

This is the code used to remotely control the mechatronics battlebot submitted for MEAM510 - Mechatronics.

An ESP8266 was used as a wifi module to connect and pass information to/from our Android phone (used as the controller). 
The C code was used to program the Teensy 2.0, which controlled our motors, LEDs, photodiode sensors, and other on boards systems.
The two boards communicated via SPI.
